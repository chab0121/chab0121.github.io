    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Nour Chabane. I am an international student studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. I am passionate about technology, creativity, and learning new digital skills. I enjoy working with computers, exploring design tools, and discovering how websites and applications are created. My goal is to become confident in web development and digital media production.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my free time, I like listening to music, watching documentaries, and practicing new software tools. I believe that <em>practice</em> is the key to improvement. I always try to stay motivated and focused on my future career. I am proud of my journey and I continue to push myself to grow academically and personally.
